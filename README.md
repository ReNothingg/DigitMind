# DigitMind
  DigitMind is a Python-based web app that recognizes handwritten digits in real-time. The user draws a digit, and a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset predicts it.  The project uses PyTorch for model training and Streamlit for an interactive UI. Input images are resized to 64Ã—64 for more flexibility and control over model architecture.
